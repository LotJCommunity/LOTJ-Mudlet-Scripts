# LOTJ-Mudlet-Scripts
Mudlet scripts written by Zakattack for use in Legends of the Jedi, with help from @Demonnic and the rest of the Mudlet core devs.

Autoflight 2.0  - An automated flight system to remove the tediousness of flying from planet to planet. 'autoflight help' for more options.
Autocargo 2.0		- An automated cargo hauler that supports any number of planets. 'autocargo help' for more information. NEEDS AUTOFLIGHT TO FUNCTION

AutoRepair 2.0	- An automated gear repairer which removes, repairs, and holds gear added to a list Does not repair weapons. 'repair help' for more options.

CombatStats	  	- A simple calculator that grabs damage output and averages damage per hit. 'combatstats help' for more options.

LOTJ Chatbox   	- DO NOT USE IF ALSO USING LOTJ-UI, which is auto-installed on connection with LOTJ. A sidebar designed to capture various channels of communications. Comes with (OOC), CommNet, (NEWBIE), (IMM), (R|P|C), ( IMM | CHAT ), (RPC), [Incoming Transmission, [Outgoing Transmission, Broadcasting Network, [PLANETARY ALERT, and buzzes as already captured channels. Adding another one is easy: go to 'triggers' and find the 'chatbox capture' trigger. In an open trigger pattern box, put in the beginning of the line you want it to capture and select 'Begin of line substring' from the drop down menu.  To adjust the size and location for the chatbox: Go to scripts > chatbox. Width='n'c and height='n'c control the height and width, where 'n' is the number of characters in length. If you change the width, be sure to change Chatbox:setWrap(n) accordingly. x = n%, y = n% control the location of the chatbox. The first n is how far from the left side the box is located and the second is how far from the top it is located.

Numpad	   	  	- Since Mudlet does not come with preset numpad macros, I exported the ones I use so you don't have to make your own. Numbers are their corresponding directions, 0 is take all, / is inv, * is gold, . is who, and you can ctrl + numpad to scan in that direction as well

Autoresearch		- use 'autoresearch start' in a library to automatically research all of your skills that are under 90%

Buildship       - Builds a single ship to completion automatically. 'buildship help' for more info.
