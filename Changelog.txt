--28 Aug 2017--

Mudlet doesn't come with one so I uploaded mine
Numbers are their corresponding directions, 0 is take all, / is inv, * is gold, . is who, and you can ctrl + numpad to scan in that direction as well

--27 Jun 2019--
-Buildship
Added buildship script. Name a ship with a 'buildship add <ship name>' and as long as the proper building materials are on the ground/in your inv it will build the ship to completion.
Does not currently support a list of multiple ships, or restarting the build if you get too tired(I've built several ships in a row with the script and never hit that level of movement drain,
so I didn't add it cause I never saw the line that says you're too tired. If someone discords me @zakattack with the echo I'll add the trigger.
Includes its own botting trigger, so please disable your own.

-Misc
Added a little script in most packages to send an echo with the relevant help alias on profile load.

Added dodge rate calculator, cleaned up combatstats print, and fixed te accuracy calculator.

--10 Jul 2019
-CombatStats
The triggers I had for gethit.taken and gethit.given were too broad and picking up various area reset messages and other ambient things. Fixed that.

--07 Aug 2019
-AutoResearch
Had a variable be 'researchauto' instead of 'autoresearch' because I'm an idiot. Pointed out by @Bistion, thanks.
Added a feature that automatically puts research at the top of the list, because it's always easier to research that first.

--11 Aug 2019
-AutoResearch
Added triggers for force spells, bounty hunting skills, and flurry.
Fixed a syntax error that wasn't picking up the "-" in vibro-blades and also ignoring lines with only one or two skills in them. Big thanks to @Demonnic for the tutelage.
Set the trigger to only capture skills below 80% to reduce spam.

Changed the "calc <planet>" alias to "autocalc <planet>"; people were accidentally using the alias when trying to calc normally. Thanks Frump

Added "" to wrap the planet name, for planets like Nal hutta. Thanks kkbug!
