--28 Aug 2017--

Mudlet doesn't come with one so I uploaded mine
Numbers are their corresponding directions, 0 is take all, / is inv, * is gold, . is who, and you can ctrl + numpad to scan in that direction as well

--27 Jun 2019--
-Buildship
Added buildship script. Name a ship with a 'buildship add <ship name>' and as long as the proper building materials are on the ground/in your inv it will build the ship to completion.
Does not currently support a list of multiple ships, or restarting the build if you get too tired(I've built several ships in a row with the script and never hit that level of movement drain,
so I didn't add it cause I never saw the line that says you're too tired. If someone discords me @zakattack with the echo I'll add the trigger.
Includes its own botting trigger, so please disable your own.

-Misc
Added a little script in most packages to send an echo with the relevant help alias on profile load.

-CombatStats
Added dodge rate calculator, cleaned up combatstats print, and fixed te accuracy calculator.

--10 Jul 2019
-CombatStats
The triggers I had for gethit.taken and gethit.given were too broad and picking up various area reset messages and other ambient things. Fixed that.

--07 Aug 2019
-AutoResearch
Had a variable be 'researchauto' instead of 'autoresearch' because I'm an idiot. Pointed out by @Bistion, thanks.
Added a feature that automatically puts research at the top of the list, because it's always easier to research that first.

--11 Aug 2019
-AutoResearch
Added triggers for force spells, bounty hunting skills, and flurry.

Set the trigger to only capture skills below 80% to reduce spam.

--19 Feb 2021
-Autoflight
Changed the "calc <planet>" alias to "autocalc <planet>"; people were accidentally using the alias when trying to calc normally. Thanks Frump
Added "autoflight clear" to clear all the variables.
Added "" to wrap the planet name, for planets like Nal hutta. Thanks kkbug!

--20 Jun 2021
-Autoresearch
Fixed the script to capture 3 word skills like "Space Combat 1"

Made it handle restricted pads a lot better. Also made it so using "showplanet <planet> resources" wouldn't bork up the jump calculations
